      Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician in the 19th century. She was the daughter of Lady and Lord Byron and was raised by her grandmother. She became friends with Charles Babbage through a mutual friend Mary Somerville and began to converse with him on a regular basis.<br><br> During some work translating an Italian mathematicians work on the Analytical Engine, she wrote a series of notes giving context to what he was saying. One of these (Note G) contained what is widely considered to be the world's first computer program.

      Grace Hopper was an US Rear Admiral as well as a computer scientist. She was one of the programmers who worked on the Harvard 1 computer. She was also the first to create the theory of machine-independent programming. Hopper also laid the groundwork for the programming language COBOL, which is still used today. Grace Hopper had a long 42 years career part of the Navy. During that, she worked on different projects such as the Mark 1 computer and the UNIVAC. The latter was known as the first large scale computer to go to market in 1950.<br>
      Even after retirement, she continued to work in the ever-changing technology industry working as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation. She stated one of her most important accomplishments was training young people.<br><br>

      <h3>Sophie Wilson</h3>
      <p>
        Sophie Wilson is a English Computer Scientist born in 1957. Originally named Roger Wilson, both her parents worked as teachers. In 1978 she joined Acorn Computers Ltd and after working with the company for 3 years she designed and developed the Acorn Proton within a week, this ended up being renamed to be the BBC Micro as the BBC had made a contract with the company after the design became a success.
        <br>
        Her other most important success was the development of ARM architecture, which was the worlds first reduced instruction set computer. Even today this processor type is extremely important, having being implemented in 95% of smartphones by 2012.

		Sophie Wilson is an English computer scientist born in 1957 she is most known for helping to design the BBC Mircro and ARM archeticure.
		She joined Acorn Computers and was vital towards the design of the BBC Micro, as well as the BBC BASIC programming language, she led this development for the next 15 years of her life. 
		Sometime in 1983 she began designing the ARM reduced instruction set computer (RISK), which entered its producting stage 2 years later. This is now the most widely used processor in smartphones!

    <b><u>Early Life</b></u>
    <br>
    <br>
    Originally named Roger Wilson and raised in Leeds, Yorkshire by both her parents which were both teachers, her mother teaching physics and her father teaching English. Starting from 1975 she studied at the Selwyn College, University of Cambrudge, pursuing a career in computer science. During an Easter break, Wilson designed a microcomputer using a MOS Technology 6502 mircroprocessor. This design would become the starting point of her long and important career.

    <b><u>Career</b></u>
    <br>
    <br>
    After designing her first microcomputer she went on to join Acorn Comptuers Ltd in 1978. The previously mentioned design was used by Chris Curry and Hermann Hauser to build the Acorn Micro-Computer, the first computer to be sold by the company.
    <br>
    Sometime in July 1981 Wilson designed and produced the Acorn Proton. This gave Acorn Computers the chance to get a contract with the BBC. Hermann Hauser decieved Wilson and a collegue of hers named Steve Furber that the other had agreed and was able to design a prototype within a week. This prototype was a success and Acorn was awarded the contract from the BBC and WIlson and Furber were present backstage when the machine first aired on TV. The Atom Proton was renamed to the BBC Micro and its BASIC eventually evolved into the BBC BASIC, which Wilson led the development of for 15 years.

    <br>
    Wilson's second biggest accomplishment took 2 years to develop and was revealed on the 26th April 1985, where the first reduced instruction set computer was introduced to the public and worked first time. This processor type is extremely significant, even today, by 2012 it was being used in 95% of smartphones.

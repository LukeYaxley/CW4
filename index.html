      In Computer Science, women only make up <a href="https://www.collegeraptor.com/Majors/Details/11.0701/Level/Bachelors-degree/State/All/Computer-Science">19% of undergraduate degrees.</a> This was not always the case and is likely due to public perception of computer science is that it is a male oriented subject. Therefore in order to combat this perception, it is important to highlight examples of women who have made an impact in the industry.
    
    In this website we will show some examples of several women who made a substanstial impact in computing including Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace and hope to illustrate portions of their lives and their contributions to Computer Science

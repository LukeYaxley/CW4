      In Computer Science, women only make up <a href="https://www.collegeraptor.com/Majors/Details/11.0701/Level/Bachelors-degree/State/All/Computer-Science">19% of undergraduate degrees.</a> This was not always the case and is likely due to public perception of computer science is that it is a male oriented subject. Therefore in order to combat this perception, it is important to highlight examples of women who have made an impact in the industry.

    In this website we will show some examples of several women who made a substantial  impact in computing including Grace Hopper, the woman who made the first program to make use of multiple files and Ada Lovelace, the woman who programmed the first computer program and hope to illustrate portions of their lives and their contributions to Computer Science.

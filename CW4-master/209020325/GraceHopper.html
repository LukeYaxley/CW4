    Grace Hopper (Grace Brewster Murray Hopper) was an American computer scientist and also United States Rear admiral. She was one of the programmers working on the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard 1</a> computer. She was also the first to create the theory of machine-independent programming languages as well as the FLOW-MATIC programming language. The extended form of this, COBOL, is still used today.<br><br>
    <b><u>Her early life</u></b>
    <br><br>
    Born in New York, Hopper is was the out of eldest out of her two other siblings. At age 7, she opened up an alarm clock to see how it works. Hopper even managed to open apart 6 more alarm clocks before her mother had noticed. At the age of 16, she was initially rejected at <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassar_College">Vassar College</a> before being admitted the next year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa (Oldest academic honour society in the US) at Vassar college with a Bachelors degree in mathematics and physics. Hopper then earned a masters degree in 1930 at Yale University.<br><br>
    <b><u>Career</u></b>
    <br>
    <u>World War 2</u>
    <br><br>

    Grace Hopper was orignally rejected from joining the war for several reasons. However, in 1943, she managed to obtain a absence of leave from Vassar college and became one of many women who volunteered to join <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAVES">WAVES</a>. In December, she reported and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmens School at Smith College in Massachusetts where she then graduated her first class in 1944 and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard. Here, she started work on the Mark 1 computer, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.<br><br>
    <u>UNIVAC</u>
    <br><br>
    In 1949, Grace became an employee of the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert%E2%80%93Mauchly_Computer_Corporation">Eckert-Maunchly Computer Corporation</a> as a senior mathematician and joined the developing team at UNIVAC (UNIVersal Automatic Computer 1). This was known as the first large scale electronic computer to go on sale in 1950.<br><br>
    <u>COBOL</u>
    <br><br>
    In 1959, COBOL (COmmom Business-Oriented Language) was created by Hopper and others with her. The new language is an extension of FLOW-MATIC and COMTRAN. Hopper created this as she believed that programs should be written in a language close to english that can be translated into machine code by the computer.<br><br>
    <b><u>Post retirement/Death</u></b>
    <br><br>
    After 42 years of her career, Admiral Grace Hopper retired on August 14th, 1986. She was then hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation. On New Years day 1992, Grace Hopper passed away at the age of 85.<br>

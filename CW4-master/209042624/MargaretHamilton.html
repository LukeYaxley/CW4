		Margaret Hamilton, born on the 17th of August 1936, (Pictured above) was an American computer scientist, known particularly for her contributions to Space travel through her work at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draper_Laboratory"> MIT Instrumentation Labratory's Software engineering division</a> which she was the director of.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most wellknown development under her lead was the onboard flight navigation for the Apollo 11 mission rocket. This software was so robust and refined that on closer inspection, there were no bugs and was key to landing on the moon, as it overwrote a command which would have otherwise aborted the landing attempt.
		</p>
		<p>
		The error was due to the pilots leaving the Radar switch on, which was overloading the onboard computer with interrupts and making it hard to, in realtime, do all the calculations for landing. This software was later adapted for regular aircraft usage.

          She was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/margaret-hamilton-apollo-software-engineer-awarded-presidential-medal-of-freedom">credited by NASA</a> for the creation of the title of "Software engineer" and many of her practices and values precipitate to modern computing, notably her insistence on intense and rigorous testing of software, stating <a href="https://earlham.edu/media/2848384/no-second-chances.pdf">"There was no second chance"</a> (In reference to the Apollo mission). This philosophy of extensive testing on software before use is still strong in modern computing and one of the cornerstones of delivering a product to a client

        <b>Further developments</b>
      </p>
        <p>
          Alongside her team, she tackled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment">Sage project</a>. This was an offshoot of the Whirlwind Project which was intended to predict weather conditions. This later developed into the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) project which was used by the US Government to track and find hostile aircraft. Her contributions on this difficult program is what brought her to the attention of NASA, leading to their offer of a position as a lead developer on the Apollo project.

        While working in the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory she was involved in several projects, mostly considering navigation and space travel. Before working on the Apollo project however, she was part of a team that developed software for detecting errors and correction in software. Her skills developed into an expertise in many areas

      Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician born in December 1815 she is regarded by many to be the first to recognise that computers had applications outside the boundaries of simple calculations. She also designed the worlds first algorithm and as such is considered to be the first programmer.<br><br>
      <b><u> Early life</u></b>
      <br>
      Lovelace was born on the 10th of December 1815, she was raised by her grandmother for much of her life and was not close with either of her parents. Her mother would have to write several letters in order to maintain a outward appearance of concern. At the time, seperation rulings would favour the husband and so each of the letters sent to her grandmother would include a cover note instructing for the letters to be saved in case motherly concern needed to be shown in court. Despite this, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K8-sQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y">in one letter Lady Byron referred to her daughter using the term "it" </a> "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own."
      <br><br>
      <b><u> Relationship to Charles Babbage</u></b>
      <br>
      Ada met Babbage for the first time in June 1833, through a mutual friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville">Mary Somerville </a> After that, he took Lovelace to see the newly constucted difference engine. Whilst there, she impressed Babbage with her knowledge of numbers. Earning a nickname from him, <i>'Enchantress of Numbers'</i>.
      <br><br><b><u>The First Computer Program</u></b> <br>Between 1842 and 1843 when translating the article of an italian mathematician on Babbages newly proposed <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical Engine</a>, Lovelace appended a set of notes explaining the function of the Analytical Engine. Contained within these notes (more specifically Note G) was instructions on how to calculate a series of Bernoulli numbers through the use of the Analytical Engine. Unfortunately, the Analytical Engine was never built and therefore Lovelace's program was never successfully ran before her death.
      <br><br><b><u>Death</u></b> <br>
      Ada Lovelace passed away on the 27th of November 1852 of uterine cancer. She was 36 years old.
       <br><br><b><u>Opinions on Artificial Intelligence</u></b> <br>
      Ada Lovelace's opinion of Artificial Intelligence is documented in her memoirs and then later referenced in Alan Turing's paper <a href ="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">COMPUTING MACHINERY AND INTELLIGENCE</a>. Her exact words on the subject were "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform." It should be noted that at the time she was talking in terms of the machines developed at the time.
